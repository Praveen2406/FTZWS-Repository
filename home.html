            <p> Imagine an international gateway where goods and merchandise flow across borders. 
                Where countries lower taxes, reduce red tape, and eliminate road blocks.
                Where companies import goods and merchandise directly into a Free Trade
                Zone without paying duties, fees, and taxes - and then export products 
                duty and tax free.
            </p>
            <p> The Miami Free Trade Zone connects North America, Europe and Asia to 
                Latin America and the Caribbean via direct air links, plus rail
                and expressway. Operated by FTZ World Services LLC, the 47-acre Zone saves companies
                money and time.
